## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation (Python)
- Cleaned and standardized raw transactional data  
- Handled missing values and validated data consistency  
- Engineered features such as age groups and purchase frequency  
- Exported cleaned data to PostgreSQL for analysis  

### 2. Data Analysis (SQL)
- Analyzed revenue and average spend by customer demographics  
- Identified high-spending customers and discount-driven products  
- Segmented customers into New, Returning, and Loyal groups  
- Compared purchasing behavior across shipping types and seasons  

### 3. Visualization (Power BI)
- Built an interactive dashboard summarizing key business metrics  
- Visualized revenue and sales by category and season  
- Analyzed subscription distribution and customer behavior  
- Enabled dynamic filtering by demographics, category, and shipping type

## Key Insights
- Clothing and Accessories generate the highest revenue  
- Subscription adoption remains low, indicating growth opportunity  
- Customers using faster shipping options tend to spend more  
- Seasonal purchasing patterns are relatively consistent  
- Strong repeat purchase behavior highlights customer loyalty
